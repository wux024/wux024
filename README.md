- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Wu. X or Adam Wiveion.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in computer vision, image processing, and deep learning. However, I am now working on chemical instrumentation.
- :memo: I'm currently learning STM32-based hardware design, and the main programming language I use is C.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me? Email: wux024@nenu.edu.cn
- :books: I have published some research papers.
